# About Project


## Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales manager wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.  

## Task:  
Imagine yourself as a Data Analyst and perform the following tasks to keep up the trust with your manager Tony Sharma. 

1. Go through the metadata and analyze the datasets thoroughly. This is the most fundamental step. 
2. Check “Recommended Insights.pdf” – this document contains a few recommendations from your manager Tony.  
3. Design a dashboard with your metrics and analysis. The dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
4. Check “ad-hoc-requests.pdf” - this document includes important business questions posed by senior executives, requiring SQL-based report generation.
5. You need to present this to the sales director - hence you need to create a convincing presentation with actionable insights.  
6. You can add more research questions and answer them in your presentation that suits your recommendations.
